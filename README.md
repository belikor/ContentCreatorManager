# ContentCreatorManager

# Warning:

# Work on the GUI may have broken the scripts.  I have not tested them and I have not updated this readme apart from this warning.  Further updates to come

## What Is This?

This aims to be a tool for small content creators to manage and promote their content on as many platforms as possible.  This tool should make it so that once set up a content creator has to do the same amount of or less work than managing one platform and still get their content everywhere and announced everywhere.

While the goals for this thing are big, it is still heavily under development.  The most alpha version of the first GUI for this has just come out

Previously there were some scripts in this project to make use of the code and while still present on the GitHub they likely do not work without some tweaking at this point so use at your own risk.  Hell all of this is use at your own risk :P

## What Can This App Currently Do?

The most current version of the app (second_gui_test.py) can load in your YouTube Videos.  It can determine if they are downloaded on the system or not.  It will show you which ones it can not find and you can tell it where they are or you can download them from YouTube.

It can do the same thing for LBRY.

In addition to this is can determine which videos are on one platform and not the other and provide you the ability to upload all or some of those videos

## How Do I Use this?

Well first thing you will need is the latest version of Python installed for your system.  [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

In addition to this there are several Python libraries you will need to install with pip:

- pip install shortuuid
- pip install ffmpeg-python
- pip install Pillow
- pip install pytube
- pip install requests
- pip install httplib2
- pip install google_auth
- pip install google_auth_oauthlib
- pip install google-api-python-client

You will also need the LBRY Desktop App installed and running

Finally you will need FFMPEG Binaries installed and in your system's Path
